# Breast-Cancer-Detection using supervised learning

##This is the code for the Breast-Cancer-Detection. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a KNN and logistic regression on a small dataset of body metrics. Then we can predict the cancer.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 


### Code
it has two models KNN and logistic regression  go throught there own readme file  respectly and , please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Breast-Cancer-Detection/Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-KNN/` or Breast-Cancer-Detection/Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-logistic regression/Code/  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_KNN.ipynb
Or
Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_KNN.ipynb
or
jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset consists of 700 data points, with each datapoint having 12 features. This dataset is breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset found on the [wisconsin Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data).

**Features**
